## jspsych-template ##

* This repository contains a template experiment for jspsych.
* The template is for a 2x2x2 study, a more complex design than is discussed in [jspsych's docs](http://docs.jspsych.org/tutorials/rt-task/).
* It is also very barebones, free for you to customise as you like. I hope this works well for you.

### Project Details ###

* This will be updated later.

### Contact ###

* This is undirectly supported. By this I mean it depends on how far into my PhD writeup I am.
* At any rate, get in touch using the details below, and if I can help then I will:
